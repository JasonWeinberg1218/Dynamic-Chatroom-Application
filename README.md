# Dynamic-Chatroom-Application

A web application that allowed users to host and manage multiple chat rooms. The application had a user login/registration system and allowed authenticated users to post messages to chat rooms in order to facilitate communication with other users. All messages were transmitted in a JSON format to/from the server and stored in a database. The chat rooms were updated in real-time. This project involved the use of Python and the Flask web framework for the backend, as well as HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, JSON, AJAJ/AJAX, and the SQLAlchemy ORM.
